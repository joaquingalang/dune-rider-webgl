# üèúÔ∏èüèçÔ∏è Dune Rider WebGL üåê
The following repository stores the WebGL environment for my Dune Rider game made in Unity 6. For more information about the project, visit the [Dune Rider repository](https://github.com/joaquingalang/dune-rider). 

Dune Rider is a simple "dodge the obstacle" game made with the Unity 6. In the game, you control a futurstic hover bike as it coasts through the desert terrain avoiding rocks.

Dune Rider was a 3-day project that served as a personal practice project as I progress through Rick Davidson's [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/?couponCode=ST21MT121624) course. 

The [hover bike](https://maxparata.itch.io/hover-bike) and [dessert building](https://maxparata.itch.io/voxel-desert-town) 3D models voxel assets were retrieved from [maxapatra](https://maxparata.itch.io/) in [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

### How To Play
- Use the `A` and `D` or `‚Üê` and `‚Üí` keys to move left and right.
- Avoid the obstacles for as long as you can.
- Try to beat your high score.

### Future Improvements

Dune Rider was created as a quick self-development project to test the concepts I've learned as I studied Unity 6. As such, the game itself is quite clunky and scuffed in some ways. To say the least, there is definitely room for improvements.

- UI Improvements
- Dynamic Particles
- SFX & Audio Implementation
- Balanced Gameplay
- Difficulty Scaling
